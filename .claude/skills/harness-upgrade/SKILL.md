# Upgrade Harness

Upgrade the project's harness infrastructure and stack traits to a target
version from the upstream harness repo. Uses structured migration files to
understand what changed, filter by relevance, and present a smart upgrade plan.

## Steps

### 1. Read current version info

Read `.harness-version` in the project root:

```
harness: claude-gh-railway-db-bucket
version: 0.2.1
repo: mistervortex/harness-engineering
companion_url: https://your-companion-site.up.railway.app
traits: nodejs, typescript, express, vitest, eslint, pnpm
```

Extract five values:
- `VARIANT`: the harness variant (e.g. `claude-gh`, `claude-gh-railway-db-bucket`)
- `CURRENT_VERSION`: the currently installed version (semver: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`)
- `REPO`: the GitHub repo (`owner/name`)
- `COMPANION_URL`: the companion site URL for fetching upgrades (may be empty)
- `TRAITS`: comma-separated list of installed trait names (may be empty)

If `.harness-version` is missing, tell the user this project doesn't appear
to be harnessed and stop.

If the `repo` field is missing, ask the user for the harness repo
(`owner/name` format) and proceed.

If the `traits` field is missing or empty, note this; you'll show all trait
changes later and suggest the user configure their traits.

### 2. Fetch upgrade data

There are two methods to fetch upgrade data. Try them in order:

#### Method A: Companion site API (preferred)

If `COMPANION_URL` is set (non-empty), fetch the upgrade manifest in a single
request:

```bash
MANIFEST=$(curl -sf "$COMPANION_URL/api/harness/upgrade?from=$CURRENT_VERSION&variant=$VARIANT&traits=$TRAITS")
```

If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies a target version, you'll filter the manifest
response to only include migrations up to that version.

The manifest returns JSON:
```json
{
  "latest_version": "0.2.16",
  "up_to_date": false,
  "migrations": [
    {
      "version": "0.2.2",
      "date": "2026-03-20",
      "summary": "...",
      "changes": [{ "scope": "...", "summary": "...", "affects": {...}, "files": [...] }]
    }
  ],
  "files": {
    "templates/claude-gh/workflows/file.yml": "<base64-encoded content>",
    "stacks/traits/runtime/nodejs.md": "<base64-encoded content>"
  }
}
```

If `up_to_date` is true, tell the user they're already up to date and stop.

The `files` map contains base64-encoded content of all relevant files. Decode
them when needed for diffing and applying changes.

If the companion site request succeeds, skip to step 4 (categorize changes).

#### Method B: GitHub API (fallback)

If `COMPANION_URL` is not set, or the companion site request fails, fall back
to the GitHub API:

```bash
LATEST_VERSION=$(curl -sf "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$REPO/main/VERSION" | tr -d '[:space:]')
```

If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies a target version, use that instead of latest.

Compare `CURRENT_VERSION` with the target version. If they match, tell the
user they're already up to date and stop.

If the target version is older than the current version, warn the user and
stop (downgrades are not supported).

If both methods fail, tell the user:
> Could not reach the harness upgrade server. You can either:
> 1. Set `companion_url` in `.harness-version` to your companion site URL
> 2. Ensure the harness repo (`$REPO`) is accessible on GitHub

### 3. Fetch migration files (GitHub fallback only)

This step only applies when using Method B (GitHub API). When using Method A
(companion site), the migrations are already included in the manifest response.

List all migration files from the upstream repo:

```bash
MIGRATION_FILES=$(curl -sf "https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO/git/trees/main?recursive=1" \
  | jq -r '.tree[] | select(.path | startswith("migrations/") and endswith(".yaml") and (. path != "migrations/README.md")) | .path')
```

Filter to only versions between `CURRENT_VERSION` (exclusive) and the target
version (inclusive) using semver comparison. For each matching migration file,
fetch and parse it:

```bash
curl -sf "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$REPO/main/migrations/$VERSION.yaml"
```

If no migration files exist for the version range, fall back to the legacy
upgrade method (step 3-legacy below).

### 3-legacy. Fall back: fetch template listing and diff (for pre-migration versions)

If no migration files cover the version range (upgrading from a version
before migrations existed), use the legacy approach:

Fetch the template file listing using the GitHub API:

```bash
curl -sf "https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO/git/trees/main?recursive=1" \
  | jq -r '.tree[] | select(.path | startswith("templates/'"$VARIANT"'/")) | .path'
```

Map template paths to local paths, fetch each file, diff against local, and
categorize as Infrastructure (replace) / Configuration (merge) / Skills
(replace). Also check for trait files: if `.claude/traits/` exists locally,
diff those against upstream `stacks/traits/`.

Then skip to step 6 (present the upgrade plan in the legacy format).

### 4. Categorize changes by relevance

Collect all `changes` entries from all fetched migration files. For each
entry, determine its relevance to this project:

**MUST APPLY**: changes matching the repo's variant:
- `scope: infrastructure` where `VARIANT` appears in `affects.variants`
- `scope: config` where `VARIANT` appears in `affects.variants`
- `scope: skill` (always applies; skills are shared across all variants)
- `scope: docs` where `VARIANT` appears in `affects.variants`

**RECOMMENDED**: trait changes matching the repo's installed traits:
- `scope: trait` where any trait in `affects.traits` appears in the repo's
  `TRAITS` list
- These update `.claude/traits/<name>.md` files

**INFORMATIONAL**: other changes that don't directly apply:
- `scope: trait` or `scope: preset` for traits/presets NOT in the repo's
  `TRAITS` list
- Show briefly so the user is aware of what's new

**SKIP**: changes for other variants:
- `scope: infrastructure` or `scope: config` where `VARIANT` is NOT in
  `affects.variants`
- Do not show these at all

If `TRAITS` is empty (not configured), treat ALL trait changes as
**RECOMMENDED** and inform the user they can configure `traits:` in
`.harness-version` to filter in future upgrades.

### 5. Fetch and diff relevant files

For each **MUST APPLY** change:
- Determine the local file path using these mapping rules:

  | Template path prefix | Local destination |
  |---|---|
  | `templates/$VARIANT/workflows/` | `.github/workflows/` |
  | `templates/$VARIANT/dependabot.yml` | `.github/dependabot.yml` |
  | `templates/$VARIANT/claude/` | `.claude/` |
  | `templates/$VARIANT/railway.json` | `railway.json` |
  | `templates/$VARIANT/.harness-version` | `.harness-version` |
  | `templates/$VARIANT/claude-md-snippet.md` | *(reference only; see step 7)* |

- **If using Method A (companion site):** the file content is already in the
  manifest's `files` map (base64-encoded). Decode it and diff against the
  local file.
- **If using Method B (GitHub API):** fetch the upstream file:
  ```bash
  curl -sf "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$REPO/main/$FILE_PATH"
  ```
  Then diff against the local file.
- If the file has changed across multiple versions in the range, only show
  the final state (diff local vs latest upstream). Note which versions
  contributed changes.

For each **RECOMMENDED** trait change:
- The upstream file is at `stacks/traits/<category>/<name>.md`
- The local file is at `.claude/traits/<name>.md`
- If the local file doesn't exist, it's a new trait to install
- If the local file exists, show the diff
- File content comes from the manifest `files` map (Method A) or GitHub
  raw URL (Method B)

For `claude-md-snippet.md`: fetch the upstream version and compare against
the project's `CLAUDE.md`. Note new sections or updates.

### 6. Present the smart upgrade plan

Present a clear, prioritized upgrade plan:

```
━━ Harness upgrade: v{CURRENT} → v{TARGET} ({N} versions) ━━

━━ REQUIRED ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Infrastructure ({VARIANT}):
  • {filename}: {summary} ({version})
    {diff}

Skills:
  • {filename}: {summary} ({version})
    {diff}

Configuration (merge carefully):
  • {filename}: {summary} ({version})
    {diff showing new entries}

━━ RECOMMENDED: Stack best practices ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠ Review carefully, may affect existing code patterns

  {trait_name} ({version}):
    {diff of .claude/traits/{name}.md vs upstream}

━━ INFORMATIONAL ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Also new since {CURRENT}:
  • New trait: {name} ({version})
  • Updated: {name} ({version})

━━ CLAUDE.md ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Suggestions from updated claude-md-snippet.md:
  {changes if any}
```

After presenting the plan, **ask the user for confirmation** before making
any changes. The user may choose to:
- Apply all changes
- Apply selectively (skip specific files or categories)
- Abort entirely

**Do NOT modify any files until the user confirms.**

### 7. Apply approved changes

Once the user approves, apply only the confirmed changes:

**Infrastructure files** (workflows, hooks, scripts): replace with upstream.

**Configuration files** (settings.json): merge new entries into the existing
config. Preserve any user-added hooks or settings. Do not remove entries the
user added.

**Skills**: replace with upstream version.

**Trait files** (`.claude/traits/<name>.md`):
- If the file exists locally: replace with upstream content from
  `stacks/traits/<category>/<name>.md`
- If the file is new: create `.claude/traits/<name>.md` with upstream content
- To find the upstream path for a trait name, search the GitHub API tree for
  files matching `stacks/traits/*/<name>.md`

**CLAUDE.md**: do NOT overwrite; only suggest additions for the user to
apply manually. If `.claude/traits/` is newly added, suggest adding this
line to CLAUDE.md:
```
Read `.claude/traits/` for stack-specific best practices before writing code.
```

### 8. Update the version stamp

Update `.harness-version` to reflect the new version, preserving the
existing variant, repo, companion_url, and traits:

```
harness: <VARIANT>
version: <TARGET_VERSION>
repo: <REPO>
companion_url: <COMPANION_URL>
traits: <TRAITS>
```

### 9. Summary

Present a summary organized by category:

- **Required, applied**: infrastructure, skill, and config files updated
- **Recommended, applied**: trait files updated
- **Recommended, skipped**: trait changes the user chose not to apply
- **Informational**: other changes in this release
- **Manual review**: CLAUDE.md suggestions or config files where local
  customizations were preserved

Remind the user to:
- Review the changes (`git diff`)
- Test that workflows and hooks still work
- Commit when satisfied
- If traits were updated, review `.claude/traits/` to ensure the new
  practices align with the project's codebase
